## Purpose: The purpose of this script is to trim sequencing adapters and low quality regions from the sequence read data with Trimmomatic,
##       and then use FASTQC to evaluate the quality of the data: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
## Trimmomatic: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic
##              Input Data: Raw R1 & R2 reads (FASTQ); Adapter sequences to remove (FASTA)
##                              Downloaded read files, R1 and R2 files for each sample if paired-end data (FASTQ)
##              Output: Trimmed R1 & R2 paired and unpaired reads (FASTQ)       
## FASTQC output is a folder for each file. The last line of this script will make a tarball of the output directory to bring back to your computer
##              Input Data: Raw R1 & R2 reads (FASTQ); Adapter sequences to remove (FASTA)
##                              Downloaded read files, R1 and R2 files for each sample if paired-end data (FASTQ)
##		Output: is a folder for each file that contains a .html file to visualize the quality, and .txt files of quality statistics.
##			The last line of this script will make a tarball of the output directory to bring back to your computer
## For running the script on the Alabama Super Computer.

## Purpose: The purpose of this script is to trim sequencing adapters and low quality regions from the read data.
## Input Data: Raw R1 & R2 reads (FASTQ); Adapter sequences to remove (FASTA)
## Output Data: Trimmed R1 & R2 paired and unpaired reads (FASTQ)

# Modules
	#  load the module

module load trimmomatic/0.39
module load fastqc/0.10.1

## STOP. You need to replace the [number] with YOUR paths to 
##       make variables for your ASC ID so the directories are automatically made in YOUR directory
MyID=[1]                        ## Example: MyID=aubtss

# Variables: raw data directory (DD), working directory(WD), Quality after cleaning (PCQ), name of file containing the adpaters.
WD=[2]                          ## Example: WD=/scratch/$MyID/PracticeRNAseq
DD=[3]                          ## Example: DD=/scratch/$MyID/PracticeRNAseq/RawData
CD=[4]                          ## Example: CD=/scratch/$MyID/PracticeRNAseq/CleanData
PCQ=PostCleanQuality
adapters=AdaptersToTrim_All.fa  ## This is a fasta file that has a list of adapters commonly used in NGS sequencing. 
				## In the future, for your data, you will likely need to edit this for other projects based on how your libraries 
				## were made to search for the correct adapters for your project
				
## make the directories to hold the Cleaned Data files, and the directory to hold the results for assessing quality of the cleaned data.
mkdir ${CD}
mkdir ${WD}/${PCQ}

################ Trimmomatic ###################################
## Move to Raw Data Directory
cd ${DD}

### Make list of file names to Trim
        ## this line is a set of piped (|) commands
        ## ls means make a list, 
        ## grep means grab all the file names that end in ".fastq", 
        ## cut that name into elements every where you see "_" and keep the first element (-f 1)
        ## sort the list and keep only the unique names and put it into a file named "list"
ls | grep ".fastq" |cut -d "_" -f 1 | sort | uniq > list

### Copy over the list of Sequencing Adapters that we want Trimmomatic to look for (along with its default adapters)
        ## CHECK: You may need to edit this path for the file that is in the class_shared directory from your account.
cp /home/${MyID}/class_shared/AdaptersToTrim_All.fa . 

### Run a while loop to process through the names in the list and Trim them with the Trimmomatic Code
while read i
do

        ### Run Trimmomatic in paired end (PE) mode with 6 threads using phred 33 quality score format. 
        ## STOP & DISCUSS: Check out the trimmomatic documentation to understand the parameters in line 77

	############## FASTQC to assess quality of the Cleaned sequence data
	## FastQC: run on each of the data files that have 'All' to check the quality of the data
	## The output from this analysis is a folder of results and a zipped file of results

fastqc ${CD}/"$i"_1_paired.fastq --outdir=${WD}/${PCQ}
fastqc ${CD}/"$i"_2_paired.fastq --outdir=${WD}/${PCQ}

done<list			# This is the end of the loop

#########################  Now compress your results files from the Quality Assessment by FastQC 
## move to the directory with the cleaned data
cd ${WD}/${PCQ}

#######  Tarball the directory containing the FASTQC results so we can easily bring it back to our computer to evaluate.
tar cvzf ${PCQ}.tar.gz ${WD}/${PCQ}/*

## when finished use scp or rsync to bring the .gz file to your computer and open the .html file to evaluate the quality of the data.
